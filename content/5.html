<h1> What is metabolic syndrome? </h1><br />
 Metabolic syndrome is a serious condition that can have a major impact on your health, and is <br />
 characterized by a combination of high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around <br />
 the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels. The risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and <br />
 diabetes increases significantly when you have metabolic syndrome. In order to reduce your risk <br />
 of developing metabolic syndrome, itâ€™s important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including <br />
 regular physical activity and a balanced diet. As a dietitian, I focus on helping people with <br />
 metabolic syndrome make lifestyle changes that are sustainable and that will help reduce their <br />
 risk factors. This includes making changes to your diet such as reducing your intake of processed <br />
 and sugary foods, increasing your consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, and eating lean <br />
 proteins. Additionally, I provide strategies for increasing physical activity, such as walking <br />
 or joining a gym. By making these lifestyle changes, you can lower your risk of developing <br />
 metabolic syndrome, and reduce the risks associated with it.</body>
